Swagger UI is the best way http://localhost:8080/dos/api/swagger-ui.html
Authentication

For simplicity, this project uses http basic authentication, which means that there's no logout option. In order to login as a different user, you will need to open a incognito window in Chrome (or private mode in Firefox). When opening webpage http://localhost:8080/dos/api/*, the alert window will appear to ask for username & password. Close this browser window after manual testing is completed.
